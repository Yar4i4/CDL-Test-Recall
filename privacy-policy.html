The CDL Test Recall app does not collect any personally identifiable information from its users. All the data used by the app, such as questions and answers for the tests, are stored locally within the application and are not transmitted or stored anywhere else.

I want to inform you that whenever you use my Service, in a case of an error in the app I may collect data and information (through third-party products) on your phone called Log Data.

The app does not use any third-party services that would collect information from you. If any such services are added in the future (for example, for advertising or analytics), this privacy policy will be updated accordingly.
